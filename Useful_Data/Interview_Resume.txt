## Resume Bullet Points
- Built an end-to-end movie sentiment analysis system using Logistic Regression and TF-IDF
- Integrated real-time movie data and reviews using the TMDB API
- Developed an interactive web application using Streamlit
- Deployed a trained ML model for real-time inference

## Interview Questions You WILL Be Asked

### Why did you use TF-IDF?
> TF-IDF captures both word importance and frequency, making it more effective than simple Bag-of-Words for sentiment analysis.

---

### Why Logistic Regression?
> Logistic Regression performs well on high-dimensional sparse text data and provides probability outputs, which helped in rating calculation.

---

### How is the rating calculated?
> I averaged the positive sentiment probabilities across reviews and scaled the result to a 0–10 range, similar to IMDb ratings.

---

### What happens if no reviews are available?
> The app handles it gracefully by notifying the user instead of producing unreliable predictions.

---

### What was the hardest part?
> Managing Streamlit’s rerun behavior and implementing proper session state handling to maintain UI flow.
